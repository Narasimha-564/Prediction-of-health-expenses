# Prediction-of-health-expenses 
# CRISP-DM model
In this project I tried to predict the health expenses of the patients.
Using a dataset provided by a hospital.
I used CRISP-DM model to build the model and described the CRISP-DM model process clearly.
Applied decision tree algorithm to predict the expenses.
Apart from appling the decisio tree algorithm I tried to increase the model accuracy by using boosting and bagging methods.
Visualized the decision tree and the realtions betweens the features using violin plots.

# CRISP-DM model Prediction-of-health-expenses 
* In this project I tried to predict the health expenses of the patients of a particular hospital based upon the data taken from the hospital.
* I worked with the CRISP-DM model for this project
* Applied decision tree algorithm to predict the expenses.
* Apart from appling the decision tree algorithm I tried to increase the model accuracy by using boosting and bagging methods.
* Visualized the decision tree using graphviz and the realtions betweens the features using violin plots.
